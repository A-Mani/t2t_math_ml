= Presentation =

``t2t_math_ml`` is
a script to be used together with [``txt2tags`` http://txt2tags.org/]
in order to translate formulas to MathML in the generated web pages.
See it on [GitHub https://github.com/Karmaki/t2t_math_ml/].

This document is used as a test for the tool.
%html% It is also compiled to [PDF test.pdf].

= Examples and Tests =

This is a simple inline formula : ''$x = \sqrt{y+z}$'' that should be parsed.

''$x = \sqrt{y+z}$'' at the begining of the line,
or at the end of the line : ''$x = \sqrt{y+z}$''

Or even one formula ''$x = \sqrt{y+z}$'' and another one ''$x = \sqrt{y+z}$''
on the same line.

We can even have lines without any formulas !

This is a one line block formula :
''' $$ x = \sqrt{a + b + c} $$

Can have space at the begining and at the and :
'''   $$ x = \sqrt{a + b + c} $$   

% but no text at the begining: ''' $$ x = \sqrt{a + b + c} $$

This is a real math block :
'''
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
'''
and another one :
'''
$$
\int_0^\infty f(x+y) dx = |z|~. 
$$
'''

It can also be on several lines:
'''
$$
|x| = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 -x & \mbox{ if } x<0 \\
  x & \mbox{ otherwise}
       \end{array} \right.
$$
